Description: 
As a part of a project at Web application development (DAW), we created API for academic management system. 
We are currently students of computer science on ISEL Lisbon, Portugal.

Main tool for project realization was Spring Boot and Maven build tool.
For this project we also used several different tools, including:
- Swagger 2 for creating ducumentation
- Siren Json representation for hypertext enrichment
- HTTP basic authentication for system authentication

More informations and detailed description of API is accesible via documentation (link will shortly be accesible here). 
In there is complete description of used methods, classes, functions, etc.
